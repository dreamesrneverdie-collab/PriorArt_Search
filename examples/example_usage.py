    A smart wearable device for continuous health monitoring that integrates multiple biosensors 
    including heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, skin temperature, and motion sensors. The device 
    uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the collected data and predict potential health issues. 
    It features wireless connectivity to sync data with a mobile application that provides 
    personalized health recommendations and alerts healthcare providers in emergency situations.
    
    The device includes a flexible display, long-lasting battery with wireless charging capability, 
    and is designed to be water-resistant for daily wear. The system employs edge computing to 
    process sensitive health data locally while using cloud services for advanced analytics and 
    data backup.
